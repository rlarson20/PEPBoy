"Excellent! This is a great project. You've correctly identified that while Sphinx is powerful, the core logic for processing PEPs is contained within this repository, and you can replicate it with more lightweight tools. The provided code is a fantastic blueprint for what you need to do.

Here is a comprehensive plan to go from the RST files to HTML, using `docutils` and `bs4`, based on the logic in the provided codebase.

### High-Level Plan

The process can be broken down into five main stages, mirroring how the existing system works:

1.  **Setup and File Discovery**: A main script to find all PEP files.
2.  **Linting/Pre-validation**: Ensure PEPs are correctly formatted before processing.
3.  **Index Generation (PEP 0)**: Create the main index file (`pep-0000.rst`) by parsing the headers of all other PEPs.
4.  **Core RST-to-HTML Conversion**: A loop that processes each RST file (including the newly generated PEP 0) and converts it to an HTML document. This is the most complex step.
5.  **Post-processing and Final Assembly**: Create the root `index.html`, generate the RSS feed, and build the `peps.json` API file.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

#### Step 1: Setup and File Discovery (done, `./backend/src/services/data_fetcher.py`)

Your main build script will be the orchestrator, analogous to `build.py`.

- **Action**: Create a main Python script.
- **Logic**: Use `pathlib` to find all PEP source files.

  ```python
  from pathlib import Path

  pep_root = Path(\"./peps\")
  pep_files = list(pep_root.glob(\"pep-????.rst\"))
  ```

- **Source Code Reference**: This simple discovery is used in `check-peps.py` to get the list of files to check.

#### Step 2: Linting and Pre-validation (somewhat unnecessary; should be handled by pre/post commit hooks on source repo)

Before you start converting, you should validate the PEPs. This will catch errors early and ensure your parsing logic doesn't fail on malformed headers.

- **Action**: Integrate the logic from `check-peps.py`. You can either run it as a subprocess or, better, import its functions directly into your build script.
- **Logic**:
  1.  Loop through each discovered PEP file.
  2.  For each file, call the checker functions from `check-peps.py` (like `check_file` or `check_peps`).
  3.  If any errors are found, report them and optionally halt the build. This script checks for crucial things like:
      - Correct header order and presence (`REQUIRED_HEADERS`).
      - Valid `Status`, `Type`, and `Created` formats.
      - Correctly formatted `Author` and email fields.
      - Discourages direct links to PEPs/RFCs in favor of RST roles.

#### Step 3: Generating PEP 0 (The Index)

PEP 0 is not a static file; it's dynamically generated from the metadata of all other PEPs. This is a critical pre-conversion step.

- **Action**: Replicate the logic from the `pep_sphinx_extensions/pep_zero_generator/` directory.
- **Logic**:

  1.  **Parse PEP Metadata**: Loop through all your `pep_files`. For each file, use the `parser.PEP` class from `pep_sphinx_extensions/pep_zero_generator/parser.py`. This class reads the RST file and parses its RFC-2822 style headers into a structured object.
      ```python
      from pep_sphinx_extensions.pep_zero_generator import parser
      all_peps = [parser.PEP(p) for p in pep_files]
      ```
  2.  **Classify and Sort PEPs**: Use the `_classify_peps` function from `pep_sphinx_extensions/pep_zero_generator/writer.py`. This sorts the PEP objects into categories (e.g., \"Accepted\", \"Draft\", \"Final\"), which is essential for building the index.
  3.  **Write `pep-0000.rst`**: Use the `writer.PEPZeroWriter` class. Its `write_pep0()` method takes the list of PEP objects and generates the full RST source code for PEP 0.

      ```python
      from pep_sphinx_extensions.pep_zero_generator import writer
      pep0_writer = writer.PEPZeroWriter()
      pep0_rst_content = pep0_writer.write_pep0(all_peps)

      # Save this to a temporary file or in-memory to be processed next
      with open(\"peps/pep-0000.rst\", \"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f:
          f.write(pep0_rst_content)
      ```

  4.  Add this newly created `pep-0000.rst` to your list of files to be converted.

#### Step 4: Core RST-to-HTML Conversion Loop

This is where you replace Sphinx. You will iterate through each PEP file (including the new `pep-0000.rst`) and convert it.

- **Action**: Create a function that takes an RST file path and outputs an HTML string.
- **Logic**: A standard `docutils` conversion isn't enough. The power of the PEP build system is in its custom RST **transforms**, **roles**, and **translator**. You must replicate these.

  1.  **Custom Transforms**: The existing build applies a series of transforms to the document tree (`doctree`) before it's rendered to HTML. You need to apply these manually.

      - **Reference**: `pep_sphinx_extensions/pep_processor/parsing/pep_parser.py` lists the exact transforms in its `get_transforms()` method.
      - **Implementation**: Use `docutils.core.publish_parts` and pass your transforms. The order is important:
        - `pep_headers.PEPHeaders`: Parses the RFC-2822 header, creates links for `Status` and `Type`, masks emails, and prettifies links in `Discussions-To`.
        - `pep_title.PEPTitle`: Moves the PEP number and Title from the header into a proper `<h1>` page title.
        - `pep_contents.PEPContents`: Generates and inserts the Table of Contents.
        - `pep_footer.PEPFooter`: Adds the \"Source\" and \"Last Modified\" links at the end of the document.

  2.  **Custom HTML Translator**: The default HTML output is slightly modified for PEPs. You need to create your own `docutils` writer with a custom translator class.

      - **Reference**: `pep_sphinx_extensions/pep_processor/html/pep_html_translator.py`. The `PEPTranslator` class is your blueprint.
      - **Implementation**: Create a class that inherits from `docutils.writers.html5_polyglot.HTMLTranslator` and override methods as done in `PEPTranslator`. Key customizations include:
        - `visit_paragraph`/`depart_paragraph`: To create \"compact paragraphs\" in list items.
        - `visit_footnote_reference`: To change the rendering of footnotes.
        - `visit_bullet_list`: To wrap the main ToC in a `<details>` disclosure widget.

  3.  **Custom Roles and Directives**: The PEPs use custom roles like `:pep:` and directives like `.. superseded::`. You need to register these with `docutils`.

      - **Reference**: `pep_role.PEPRole` and `pep_banner_directive.py`.
      - **Implementation**:
        - For `:pep:`, create a function based on `PEPRole` and register it using `docutils.parsers.rst.roles.register_local_role`.
        - For directives like `.. superseded::`, create classes based on `PEPBanner` and its subclasses, and register them using `docutils.parsers.rst.directives.register_directive`.

  4.  **Putting it Together (Pseudo-code)**:

      ```python
      from docutils.core import publish_parts
      from docutils.writers import Writer
      # Import your custom transforms, roles, directives, and translator
      # from the peps codebase.

      # Register custom roles and directives
      # roles.register_local_role(...)
      # directives.register_directive(...)

      class MyPEPWriter(Writer):
          def __init__(self):
              super().__init__()
              self.translator_class = MyPEPTranslator # Your version of PEPTranslator

      for pep_file_path in all_pep_files:
          rst_content = pep_file_path.read_text()

          # The settings object can be used to pass in things like pep_url
          settings_overrides = {
              'pep_url': 'pep-{:0>4}.html',
              'transforms': [
                  PEPHeaders, PEPTitle, PEPContents, PEPFooter
              ],
              # You might need other settings from conf.py
          }

          parts = publish_parts(
              source=rst_content,
              writer=MyPEPWriter(),
              settings_overrides=settings_overrides,
          )

          # Now you have the HTML parts. 'title', 'html_body', etc.
          # You can inject these into a template.
          html_output = template.render(
              title=parts['title'],
              body=parts['html_body'],
              toc=parts['fragment'] # The ToC is in fragment
          )

          # Save html_output to a file like 'build/pep-NNNN.html'
      ```

#### Step 5: Post-processing and Final Assembly with `bs4`

After you've generated all the individual HTML files, there are a few final steps. This is where `bs4` can be very useful.

- **Action**: Run these steps after your main conversion loop.
- **Logic**:
  1.  **Create Root `index.html`**:
      - **Reference**: `build.py`'s `create_index_file` function.
      - **Implementation**: Copy the contents of the generated `build/pep-0000.html` to `build/index.html`. You can use `bs4` here to adjust relative links if you're using a `dirhtml`-style output.
  2.  **Generate RSS Feed**:
      - **Reference**: `pep_sphinx_extensions/generate_rss.py`.
      - **Implementation**: This script works by reading the pickled `doctree` files that Sphinx creates. You will have to adapt this. Instead of reading doctrees, you can get the required information (PEP number, title, creation date, abstract) from the `parser.PEP` objects you created in Step 3. The `pep_abstract` function in the script shows how to extract the abstract; you can adapt it to work on your `docutils` document object.
  3.  **Generate `peps.json` API**:
      - **Reference**: `pep_sphinx_extensions/pep_zero_generator/pep_index_generator.py`'s `create_pep_json` function.
      - **Implementation**: This is straightforward. It just takes the list of `parser.PEP` objects and uses the `full_details` property to create a JSON file. You already have these objects from Step 3.
  4.  **Final HTML Manipulation with `bs4`**:
      - Docutils will give you a solid HTML body. You can use BeautifulSoup to do final clean-up or enhancements across all generated files.
      - For example: adding a specific class to all external links, injecting analytics snippets, or standardizing the `<head>` section of all documents.

By following this plan, you will effectively re-implement the PEP build process using `docutils` and `bs4` while preserving all the critical, PEP-specific logic contained in the original codebase. The key is to see the existing `pep_sphinx_extensions` not as something to discard, but as a detailed specification for what your new `docutils`-based pipeline needs to do."
