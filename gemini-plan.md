Of course. Building a project is much smoother with a clear, detailed plan. Based on your project description, the provided files, and our previous conversation, here is a comprehensive plan to guide you from setting up your development environment to finishing a resume-worthy PEP viewing site.

This plan contains **no code**, only the steps and strategies you'll need to follow.

### **Part 1: Comprehensive Development Environment Setup**

This section details the steps to get your FastAPI backend and React frontend running locally and communicating with each other.

#### **Prerequisites**
*   Ensure you have **Node.js** (which includes `npm`) installed.
*   Ensure you have **`uv`** installed for Python package management. You can install it with `pip`, `pipx`, or your system's package manager.

#### **A. Backend Setup (FastAPI)**

1.  **Navigate to the Backend Directory:**
    Open your terminal and change into the `backend` directory.

2.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment:**
    *   Use `uv` to create a new virtual environment: `uv venv`
    *   Activate the environment. On macOS/Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`. On Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`. Your terminal prompt should now indicate you are in the `.venv`.

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   Your `pyproject.toml` is already defined. Install all project and development dependencies using `uv`:
        `uv pip install -e .[dev]`
    *   The `-e` flag installs the project in "editable" mode, so changes you make to the source code are immediately reflected.
    *   The `[dev]` part installs the optional dependencies listed under `[project.optional-dependencies].dev`.

4.  **Initialize the Database:**
    *   Alembic is listed in your dependencies. You will use it to manage database schema migrations.
    *   Run the init command: `alembic init alembic`
    *   This will create an `alembic` directory and an `alembic.ini` file. You will need to configure `alembic.ini` to point to your database (for local development, this will be a SQLite file, e.g., `sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///./pep_viewer.db`). You will also need to edit `alembic/env.py` to connect your SQLAlchemy models.

5.  **Start the Development Server:**
    *   The Vite config proxies to `http://localhost:8420`, so we'll run the backend on that port.
    *   Create a main application file inside `backend/src/` (e.g., `main.py` or `app.py`) where you will instantiate your FastAPI app.
    *   Run the Uvicorn server with hot-reloading: `uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8420 --reload`
    *   Replace `src.main:app` with the actual path to your FastAPI app instance. You should see Uvicorn start up and confirm the server is running.

#### **B. Frontend Setup (React + Vite)**

1.  **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**
    In a **new terminal window**, change into the `frontend` directory.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   The `package.json` file lists all necessary Node.js dependencies. Install them using `npm`:
        `npm install`

3.  **Improve Linter Configuration (Recommended):**
    *   Your `frontend/README.md` and `eslint.config.js` show a minimal ESLint setup. For a professional project, it's highly recommended to enable stricter, type-aware linting rules as suggested in the README.
    *   This involves installing extra plugins (`eslint-plugin-react-x`, etc.) and modifying `eslint.config.js` to use `tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked`. This will help you catch more bugs and write cleaner code.

4.  **Start the Development Server:**
    *   Run the Vite development server using the script defined in `package.json`:
        `npm run dev`
    *   Vite will start the server (usually on port 5173) and print the local URL. Open this URL in your browser.

#### **C. Running Both Concurrently**
With both terminals open and running:
*   The **FastAPI backend** is serving the API on `http://localhost:8420`.
*   The **React frontend** is running on `http://localhost:5173` (or similar).
*   Thanks to the `proxy` configuration in `frontend/vite.config.ts`, any API request your React app makes to `/api/...` will be automatically forwarded to your backend at `http://localhost:8420/api/...`. This completely bypasses any CORS issues during development.

### **Part 2: Resume-Ready Project Roadmap**

This roadmap is broken into three phases, taking you from a basic, functional product to a polished, deployed application.

#### **Phase 1: Building the Core Functionality (MVP)**
*Goal: Create a working site where users can find, view, and search for PEPs.*

1.  **Backend - Data Layer & Core API:**
    *   **Database Modeling:** In a `models.py` file, define your SQLAlchemy table models. You'll need tables for `PEP`, `Author`, and likely a join table to handle the many-to-many relationship between them. The columns should reflect the fields in `peps.json`.
    *   **Initial Migration:** After defining your models, create your first Alembic migration (`alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial schema"`) and apply it (`alembic upgrade head`) to create the database file and tables.
    *   **Data Ingestion Service:** Create a module responsible for fetching data. It should have one function to get `peps.json` and another to fetch the content from a PEP's `url`. As discussed, this content will be HTML/RST, not Markdown.
    *   **Content Parsing & Cleaning:** Use `docutils` (for RST) and `BeautifulSoup4` (for cleanup) to parse the fetched PEP content. Your goal is to extract the core PEP text, convert it to clean HTML, and store it.
    *   **Database Population Script:** Create a standalone Python script that uses your ingestion service to fetch all PEPs and populate your database. Run this once manually to seed your data.
    *   **API Pydantic Schemas:** Define Pydantic models for API responses to ensure type-safe and consistent data contracts.
    *   **Core API Endpoints:** Create the FastAPI endpoints:
        *   `GET /api/peps`: List all PEPs. Implement pagination (`skip`, `limit`) and filtering (by `status`, `type`).
        *   `GET /api/peps/{pep_number}`: Fetch a single PEP's details and its parsed HTML content.
        *   `GET /api/search`: Set up a search endpoint using SQLite's FTS5 capabilities. It should take a query parameter `q`.

2.  **Frontend - Views & Components:**
    *   **Routing:** Use `react-router-dom` to define routes for the Home Page (`/`), PEP Detail Page (`/peps/:pep_number`), and Search Results Page (`/search`).
    *   **API Service:** Create a dedicated file (e.g., `src/services/api.ts`) using `axios` to house all functions that call your backend endpoints.
    *   **Component Structure:** Break down the UI into components: `Layout`, `Header`, `Footer`, `SearchBar`, `PepList`, `PepListItem`, `PepDetailView`, `PaginationControls`.
    *   **PEP List Page:** Build the main page that fetches and displays the list of PEPs from `/api/peps`, including filters and pagination.
    *   **PEP Detail Page:** This page will fetch a single PEP from `/api/peps/{pep_number}`. You will need to render the HTML content from the backend. **Security Note:** Use a library like `DOMPurify` to sanitize the HTML before rendering it with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to prevent XSS attacks.
    *   **Search Functionality:** Implement the UI for the `SearchBar` and the search results page, connecting it to your `/api/search` endpoint.

#### **Phase 2: Enhancing User Experience & Polish**
*Goal: Refine the MVP with a professional design and features that make it a pleasure to use.*

1.  **Backend - Automation & Optimization:**
    *   **Scheduled Updates:** Use `APScheduler` to create a background job that runs your database population script daily, ensuring the data is always fresh.
    *   **Improved Content Parsing:** Enhance your `docutils` pipeline to automatically generate a Table of Contents (TOC) from the PEP's headers and to resolve `:pep:` cross-references into internal links (e.g., `/peps/8`). Add this data to your API responses.
    *   **Caching:** Implement caching for your API endpoints to reduce database load and improve response times, especially for the main PEP list and individual PEPs.

2.  **Frontend - Design & Interactivity:**
    *   **UI/Styling:** Choose and integrate a UI framework like **Shadcn/ui** (for a modern, composable approach) or a component library like **MUI/Mantine**. Focus on creating a clean, readable, and professional look.
    *   **Responsive Design:** Ensure the entire site looks great and is fully functional on devices of all sizes, from mobile phones to large desktops.
    *   **State Management:** For managing complex state like filters, search queries, and bookmarks, consider a lightweight state manager like **Zustand**.
    *   **TOC Navigation:** On the PEP detail page, display the TOC provided by the backend as a sticky sidebar. Implement smooth scrolling when a user clicks a link.
    *   **Loading & Error States:** Add loading indicators (skeletons, spinners) for all data-fetching operations and display user-friendly error messages if an API call fails.
    *   **Syntax Highlighting:** The backend's parsed HTML should include classes for code blocks. Use a frontend library like `highlight.js` or `react-syntax-highlighter` to apply syntax highlighting based on these classes.

#### **Phase 3: Advanced Features & Deployment Readiness**
*Goal: Add final features and prepare the project for a live, public deployment.*

1.  **Backend - Production Hardening:**
    *   **Configuration:** Move all hardcoded settings (like the database URL) to environment variables using a library like Pydantic's `BaseSettings`.
    *   **Containerization:** Write a `Dockerfile` for the FastAPI application. This makes deployment consistent and straightforward.
    *   **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests for your API endpoints and services using `pytest`. Aim for good test coverage.

2.  **Frontend - Final Features & Optimization:**
    *   **Client-Side Features:** Implement the Bookmarks and Notes features using `localStorage`. Create a new page (`/bookmarks`) to list saved PEPs.
    *   **Accessibility (a11y):** Perform an accessibility audit. Ensure proper semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and color contrast.
    *   **Performance:** Use Vite's build analysis tools to inspect your bundle. Implement lazy loading for routes and components where appropriate to improve initial page load time.
    *   **SEO:** Add dynamic page titles and meta descriptions for each PEP page to improve search engine visibility.

3.  **Deployment & Final Touches:**
    *   **Backend Deployment:** Deploy your containerized backend to a platform like **Render** or **Railway**. These services make it easy to deploy Docker containers and provision a PostgreSQL database (a more robust alternative to SQLite for production).
    *   **Frontend Deployment:** Build the static frontend assets (`npm run build`) and deploy them to a service like **Vercel** or **Netlify**. Configure it to point to your live backend API URL.
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up **GitHub Actions** to create a simple continuous integration/continuous deployment pipeline. On each push to your `main` branch, the action should automatically:
        1.  Install dependencies for backend and frontend.
        2.  Run linters.
        3.  Run tests.
        4.  (On success) Trigger a redeployment on your hosting platforms.
    *   **Documentation:** Thoroughly update your project's root `README.md` with a project overview, screenshots, links to the live site, and detailed instructions for setting up and running the project locally. This is the first thing a recruiter will see.
