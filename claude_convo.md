## User

I'm trying to build a small portfolio project in Python. I want to make a tool that will let users read Python Enhancement Proposals on a nice little website. I want to make a backend using FastAPI, not sure about the frontend right now but probably React, Vue or Svelte, something nice. I don't want you writing ANY CODE! I want to do this myself, I just want you to plan this out because I know if I had a fleshed out, detailed and comprehensive plan for getting a minimum viable product out, I could spit this out really quick.

## Claude

**TL;DR**

- Scrape/fetch PEPs from python.org, store in SQLite with full-text search
- FastAPI backend with endpoints for listing, searching, and serving PEPs
- Frontend consumes API, renders markdown with syntax highlighting
- Deploy backend to Railway/Render, frontend to Vercel/Netlify

## Architecture Questions

Before diving into the plan, need clarity on scope:

1. **PEP data source**: Scrape python.org/peps live, or batch fetch and store locally? How fresh does data need to be?

2. **Search complexity**: Basic text search, or full semantic search with embeddings? Title/author/status filtering sufficient?

3. **PEP rendering**: Raw markdown display, or parsed with proper syntax highlighting, cross-references, and navigation?

4. **User features**: Read-only browsing, or bookmarks/notes/favorites? Any user accounts?

5. **Deployment target**: Self-hosted VPS, cloud platforms, or local development only initially?

## MVP Plan Structure

**Backend (FastAPI)**

- PEP data ingestion pipeline
- SQLite database with FTS5 for search
- REST API endpoints
- Background task for PEP updates

**Frontend (React/Vue/Svelte)**

- PEP browser with search/filter
- Markdown renderer with syntax highlighting
- Responsive design for mobile reading

**Infrastructure**

- Database schema design
- Deployment pipeline
- Basic monitoring/logging

**Development workflow**

- Local dev setup with hot reload
- Testing strategy for API endpoints
- Frontend build process

Want me to elaborate on any of these areas, or should I flesh out the complete implementation plan with specific technical decisions?

## User

1. https://peps.python.org/api/peps.json is a source of Python Enhancement Proposals that I can use to populate a database that checks for updates every day.
2. Full text search through SQLite initially, embeddings can be implemented after v1 is done
3. Parsed with proper syntax highlighting, navigation, probably cross-refs
4. Bookmarks and notes could work; no need for user accounts, could use local storage or something similar
5. Local development only initially, once v1 is ready to be deployed, then we determine where it's hosted

Let's elaborate on these areas a bit before we start the implementation plan

## Claude

**TL;DR**

- JSON API simplifies ingestion, daily cron job for updates
- SQLite FTS5 handles search well for PEP corpus size
- Markdown parsing needs PEP-specific link resolution
- LocalStorage bookmarks avoid auth complexity
- Local-first development enables quick iteration

## Data Ingestion Deep Dive

**PEP JSON structure analysis needed**

- What fields are available? (title, author, status, created, content URL?)
- Are PEP contents inline or do we fetch individual PEP files?
- How to detect changes/updates for incremental sync?

**Update strategy**

- Daily job checks JSON for new/modified PEPs
- Compare timestamps or hash content to detect changes
- Batch database updates vs individual upserts

## Search Implementation Details

**SQLite FTS5 capabilities**

- Full-text across title, abstract, content body
- Ranking with BM25, phrase queries, prefix matching
- Filter by status (Draft, Accepted, Final, etc.), author, PEP number ranges

**Search UX considerations**

- Autocomplete on PEP titles/numbers
- Search result snippets with highlighted matches
- Faceted search (status, author, date ranges)

## Content Rendering Challenges

**PEP-specific markdown quirks**

- Cross-references to other PEPs (PEP 8, PEP-0008 formats)
- Links to Python docs, GitHub issues, mailing lists
- Code blocks in multiple languages, not just Python
- Tables, diagrams, reStructuredText vs Markdown inconsistencies

**Navigation features**

- Table of contents extraction from headers
- "Related PEPs" based on cross-references
- Chronological/status-based browsing

## Frontend Storage Strategy

**LocalStorage approach**

- Bookmarks: array of PEP numbers with timestamps
- Notes: key-value pairs (PEP number → note text)
- Reading progress tracking per PEP
- Export/import for backup

**Data sync considerations**

- No backend user state = no cross-device sync initially
- Could add optional GitHub gist backup later

Ready for the detailed implementation plan, or want to drill down on any of these areas first?

## User

1. Here's the first item in the .json output:

```json
"1": { "number": 1, "title": "PEP Purpose and Guidelines", "authors": "Barry Warsaw, Jeremy Hylton, David Goodger, Alyssa Coghlan", "discussions_to": null, "status": "Active", "type": "Process", "topic": "", "created": "13-Jun-2000", "python_version": null, "post_history": "21-Mar-2001, 29-Jul-2002, 03-May-2003, 05-May-2012, 07-Apr-2013", "resolution": null, "requires": null, "replaces": null, "superseded_by": null, "author_names": [ "Barry Warsaw", "Jeremy Hylton", "David Goodger", "Alyssa Coghlan" ], "url": "https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/" },
```

2. Need to fetch pep content from url field in JSON
3. unsure; some kind of md5 hash maybe? welcome to advice here

let's dive into the Content Rendering then I think we can take the implementation plan on

## Claude

**TL;DR**

- PEP content is at predictable URLs, fetch individual HTML/RST
- Change detection via ETags or content hashing most reliable
- PEP cross-refs follow standard patterns, parseable with regex
- reStructuredText dominant format, needs rst2html pipeline

## PEP Content Fetching

**URL patterns from your JSON**

- `https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/` → HTML rendering
- Raw source likely at `https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/pep-0001.rst` or similar
- Need to determine: fetch rendered HTML or raw RST for parsing control?

**Change detection strategy**

```
Option 1: ETags/Last-Modified headers (cleanest)
Option 2: SHA-256 hash of content body (reliable)
Option 3: Compare post_history field changes (fragile)
```

ETags preferred if python.org supports them; content hashing as fallback.

## Content Format Analysis

**reStructuredText dominance**

- Most PEPs written in RST, not Markdown
- Need `docutils` or `rst2html` for proper parsing
- Sphinx extensions handle Python-specific directives

**Cross-reference patterns**

```
:pep:`8` → PEP 8 link
:pep:`PEP 8 <8>` → Custom link text
:rfc:`2822` → RFC links
:ref:`reference-label` → Internal anchors
```

**Code block handling**

```rst
.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   def example():
       pass
```

## Rendering Pipeline Considerations

**RST → HTML conversion**

- `docutils` with custom writer for clean HTML
- Preserve code highlighting, tables, admonitions
- Strip/modify navigation elements from python.org template

**Link resolution**

- Rewrite PEP cross-refs to internal routes (`/pep/8`)
- Preserve external links (RFCs, GitHub, mailing lists)
- Handle broken internal references gracefully

**Syntax highlighting**

- `pygments` integration for code blocks
- Multiple language support (Python, C, shell, etc.)
- Line numbering and copy-to-clipboard features

**Navigation extraction**

- Parse RST headers for TOC generation
- Extract "Abstract", "Rationale", "Specification" sections
- Build section anchor links for deep navigation
